# Week 15-Interactive-Visualizations-and-Dashboards 
## Objectives
* Use Plotly to create the fundamental charts: Box, scatter, bar, pie, and line plots.
* Use Plotly's `layout` object to customize the appearance of their charts.
* Annotate charts with labels; text; and hover info.
* Create and manipulate advanced Plotly charts.
* Create bubble charts to visualize three-dimensional data.
* Use Flask to serve data to a Plotly frontend.

### Why would I use Plotly instead of Matplotlib or another library?
* While Plotly.js is not necessarily "better" than Matplotlib or another plotting library, it is useful for a variety of reasons! Plotly is also incredibly popular in the data community.

* Plotly.js uses both D3.js and WebGL to render graphics, works with JSON schema, and supports a large variety of map charts, including basic, statistical, financial, and scientific!

# Plot.ly Homework - Belly Button Biodiversity

![Bacteria by filterforge.com](Images/bacteria_by_filterforgedotcom.jpg)

In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity DataSet](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/).

### Before You Begin

1. Create a new repository for this project called `plotly-challenge`. **Do not add this homework to an existing repository**.

2. Clone the new repository to your computer.

3. Inside your local git repository, create a directory for the Plotly challenge. Use the folder name to correspond to the challenge: **Belly_Button_Diversity**.

4. This is a full stack app so add your html, js, css, python and sqlite files.

5. Push the above changes to GitHub or GitLab.

## Step 1 - Plotly.js

Use Plotly.js to build interactive charts for your dashboard.

* Create a PIE chart that uses data from your samples route (`/samples/<sample>`) to display the top 10 samples.

  * Use `sample_values` as the values for the PIE chart.

  * Use `otu_ids` as the labels for the pie chart.

  * Use `otu_labels` as the hovertext for the chart.

* Create a Bubble Chart that uses data from your samples route (`/samples/<sample>`) to display each sample.

  * Use `otu_ids` for the x values.

  * Use `sample_values` for the y values.

  * Use `sample_values` for the marker size.

  * Use `otu_ids` for the marker colors.

  * Use `otu_labels` for the text values.

  ![Bubble Chart](Images/bubble_chart.png)

* Display the sample metadata from the route `/metadata/<sample>`

  * Display each key/value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.

* Update all of the plots any time that a new sample is selected.

* You are welcome to create any layout that you would like for your dashboard. An example dashboard page might look something like the following.

## Step 2 - Heroku

Deploy your Flask app to Heroku.

* You can use the provided sqlite file for the database.

* Ask your Instructor and TAs for help!

## Advanced Challenge Assignment (Optional)

The following task is completely optional and is very advanced.

* Adapt the Gauge Chart from <https://plot.ly/javascript/gauge-charts/> to plot the Weekly Washing Frequency obtained from the `/metadata/<sample>`route.

* You will need to modify the example gauge code to account for values ranging from 0 - 9.

* Update the chart whenever a new sample is selected.

## Flask API

Use Flask API starter code to serve the data needed for your plots.

* Test your routes by visiting each one in the browser.

- - -

## Hints

* Don't forget to `pip install -r requirements.txt` before you start your server.

* Use `console.log` inside of your JavaScript code to see what your data looks like at each step.

* Refer to the [Plotly.js Documentation](https://plot.ly/javascript/) when building the plots.
